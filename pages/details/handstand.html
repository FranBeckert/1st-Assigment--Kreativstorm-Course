        A handstand is the act of supporting the body in a stable, inverted
        vertical position by balancing on the hands. In a
        <strong>basic handstand</strong>, the body is held straight with arms
        and legs fully extended, with hands spaced approximately shoulder-width
        apart. There are many <strong>variations of handstands</strong> , but in
        all cases a handstand performer must possess adequate balance and upper
        body strength.
